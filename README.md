# Console Buddy

Ever have debugging tricks, aliases, or shortcuts that don't make sense as application code but, are super helpful in the console? Console Buddy allows you to use dozens of helpful console methods, shortcuts, and helpers. You can also define custom helpers for your application that will always be loaded in your Rails console when you need it.

## Setup

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'console_buddy'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install console_buddy

## Basic Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
